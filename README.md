# LinearRegression

Linear Regression is one of the most studied algorithms for Machine Learning. It is a statistical technique that uses a linear approach to represent the relationship between the target feature and descriptive features [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)]. It attempts to find the underlying function that uses these descriptive features and predicts the target feature, i.e. forecast target value as a scalar function of descriptive features.

The descriptive features are the inputs of a function and the target feature is an output. By using Linear Regression, we look for the best function that represents the given inputs. This input does not contain the complete list of combinations available, due to the problem size, as the reader probably has an idea of why, if not then we will leave this as an exercise for the reader to know.
